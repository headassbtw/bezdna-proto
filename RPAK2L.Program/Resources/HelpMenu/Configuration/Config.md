# Configuring #
All of the settings for this tool will be found in the Settings menu, found in the Options tab on the top strip

The settings may be a bit unstable and internally fragmented, so things may not work as expected

In the settings window, you'll see two main components, a list of settings, and an "Apply" button.
The settings items behave like any other settings menu, with the exceptions of it being buggy as shit because i made it,
and not applying until you hit "Apply" as to not hammer your drive.
Hitting apply writes to the `Settings.ini` file in the same directory as the tool's executable, and opening the window reads from it.
(Note here, I'm pretty shit at consolidation, so atm things may not work properly until a tool restart.)
