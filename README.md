# bezdna-proto
This repo is now unprivated, but keep in mind this project was done early on and has a lot of unwanted jank I tried to overcome in bezdna-rs (now private).
My focus later shifted to Apex because that game has a newer engine and more capabilities compared to r2's version, and R5Reloaded became a thing eventually.
Don't judge my ability to code based on that repo - I was almost always drunk when writing code for it (Russki Hazkerman grind).
