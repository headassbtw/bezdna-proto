[![CI](https://github.com/headassbtw/rpak2l/actions/workflows/Build_fix.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/headassbtw/rpak2l/actions/workflows/Build_fix.yml)

i forked this repo, not only to preserve the code, but also to add a GUI to the program, since a half decent rpak GUI does not exist yet (looking at you, legion...)

Quick Overview:
